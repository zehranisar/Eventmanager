Event Manager
University Event Management System

Abstract
Event Manager is an Android-based university event management system designed to streamline the creation, management, and participation of academic and non-academic events. The application integrates an Android frontend with a Django REST backend to provide a centralized, secure, and efficient platform for students and administrators. The system supports role-based authentication, event registration, email notifications, reminders, and an admin dashboard for monitoring activities. Event Manager reduces manual effort, improves communication, and enhances overall event coordination within educational institutions.

Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Background
Universities frequently organize seminars, workshops, sports events, and cultural activities. Traditionally, these events are managed through notice boards, social media groups, or manual registration methods. Such approaches often lead to poor communication, missed deadlines, and inefficient record keeping.
1.2 Problem Statement
Manual event management systems lack centralization, real-time updates, and proper tracking of registrations. Students may miss important events, and administrators face difficulties in managing participant data and event statistics.
1.3 Proposed Solution
Event Manager provides a digital platform where administrators can create and manage events, and students can easily view, register, and receive reminders for events through a mobile application.
1.4 Objectives
• To digitalize the university event management process
• To provide a centralized event platform for students
• To enable secure authentication and role-based access
• To provide reminders and notifications for events
• To assist administrators with analytics and monitoring
